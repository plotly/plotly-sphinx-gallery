# Gallery of examples using plotly and sphinx-gallery

This repository shows how to use the Python
[plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) visualization library and Sphinx's
extension [sphinx-gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/) to create a
graphical gallery of examples.

The configuration of the gallery is set up in `docs/conf.py` and uses
a custom scraper for plotly.
